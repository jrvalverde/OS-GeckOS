The "sysapps" directory contains system-dependend programs. These include

  - filesystem servers

  - internet servers

  - hardware dependend stuff (like irtx or ibmon)

  - some old programs that have not been ported to lib6502 or are not worth
    the time doing it (if you like, port them and I move them to apps)
