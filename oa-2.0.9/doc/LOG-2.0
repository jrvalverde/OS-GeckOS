2.0.9 - 06oct2013 - A. Fachat

- fixed an uninitialized variable bug in the console driver that only showed
  on the real machine

- fixed build problems for the c64 ("notimp" code in lib6502 jump table)

- lsh got cmdline option where to CHDIR on start, ROMs set it to boot drive
  Also got a new "reset" command

- adapt new c1541 command syntax for formatting an x64 file


2.0.8 - 20dec1998 - A. Fachat

- console device now implements TC_CPOS multibyte control code
  to place cursor directly on screen.

- init features MMU mode to scan second bank for the ROM link 
  chain to execute. It uses the "magic" non-sysapp to determine 
  if it found one.

- break fsibm into parts, especially separate the hardware (WD1770)
  driver from the rest. Implement a RAMdisk driver for fsibm.

- moved computation of DPB and translation of linear address -> C/H/S
  into hardware driver. Implemented "linear" ramdisk driver.

- made fsibm loadable as o65 file. 
  increase memory size for CS/A65 lib6502 files from 4 to 12k.
  loading sometimes doesn't work...

- fix kernel/init to make booting TESTROM image work

- init now handles second ROM image in INIT_MMU_BANK
  Started work on SCSI driver for FSIBM

- continued working on SCSI driver for FSIBM. 
  + Now formating hangs at the
    _end_ of the sequence, probably disk name error? (test with emulator?)
  + formating only sets to small disk size...

- formating works for ramdisk device - leaving the old boot sector.

- continued working on SCSI driver. Had to use div32 instead of div at
  several places because cluster/sector >= 0x8000 bugged out!
  Now computes right number of sectors when formating SCSI harddisk.
  TODO: - copying a file to FSIEC stops after 128 byte - Stream problem?
        - bytes free decrease by approx. double the used amount

- FSIBM can now use FAT16 partitions above 32M, but boot sector is
  not standard and FSIBM_SECTOR24BIT has to be defined.

- The scsi/hd driver can now us the xcsa ramdisk
