This is a sample implementation of an embedded version of the GeckOS.
It is reduced to basic scheduling and interrupt handling and has 
thus removed the 

- streams

- memory management

- file manager

- send/receive

- semaphores

This shortens the kernel to almost 2k in size.
Also the used amount of RAM is $bc = 188 byte normal RAM,
plus $e = 14 byte zeropage (not counting the environment, task and
thread save 6 bytes from addresses 2-8), also not counting 
the possible use of PCBUF by fork and devcmd. 
1k RAM total should be sufficient for simple applications.

Using the PCBUF without locking with a semaphore should be handled with 
care.
